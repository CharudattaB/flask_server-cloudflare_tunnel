If its you first time installing you should run Setup.bat file as it will install both python and cloudflare tunnel.
and run the app with tunnel.
when your running for second time just run runner.bat it would just run installed tunnel and app.py
Enjoy you app or share it via link created by cloudflare in terminal !!!!!!!!!!
